<b>Description:</b><br>
Optical sensing for AutoSet - first revision (Maker Faire).
<ul>
<li> power comes in on terminal blocks</li>
<li> three sensors - two for sensing, one for compensaiton</li>
<li> ambient light compensation performed via two differential op-amps</li>
<li> conversion to digial signal via comparators with hysteresis</li>
<li> digial signal travels to motor control board via terminal blocks.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b> NOTES:</b>
<ul>
<li>Sensors should be position such that the direction of travel is orthgonal to the incedent angle of reflection. This was incorrect on the first revision of the dual-encoding board, and degrades the ability to sense accurately.</li>
<li>Resistors on the comparators are not correct for the hysteresis needed.</li>
<li>Compensation sesnor and op-amps not populated (and therefore not tested.</li>
</ul>
